# Weekend SQL To Do List

## Description

I created a 'TO DO' application. The front end experience allows a user to create a Task. When the Task is created, it is stored inside of the database (SQL). The front end will refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed. Each Task has an option to 'Complete' or 'Remove'. When a Task is complete, its visual representation is crossed out. This was accomplished in CSS and hooks into the logic to know whether or not the task is complete. When a Task is deleted, the Task is removed from both the front end as well as the Database.
